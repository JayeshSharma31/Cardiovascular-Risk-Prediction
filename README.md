Summery :

The dataset is from an ongoing cardiovascular study on residents of the town of Framingham, Massachusetts. The classification goal is to predict whether the patient has a 10-year risk of
Future coronary heart disease (CHD). The dataset provides the patients’ information. It includes over 4,000 records and 15 attributes.

The objective of the project is to come up with the machine learning model to predict whether a patient has 10-year risk of developing coronary heart disease (CHD) using the residents of the town of Framingham, Massachusetts dataset.

In this project I faced problems like Handling the missing values, Making data more accurate and Selection of important features etc.

I got following conclusion -
• The people who have Cardiovascular heart disease is almost equal between smokers and non smokers.
• The top features in predicting the ten year risk of developing Cardiovascular Heart 
Disease are 'age', 'totChol', 'sysBP', 'diaBP', 'BMI', 'heartRate', 'glucose'.
• The Support vector machine with the radial kernel is the best performing model in terms of accuracy and the F1 score and Its high AUC-score shows that it has a high true positive rate.
• Balancing the dataset by using the SMOTE technique helped in improving the models' sensitivity.
